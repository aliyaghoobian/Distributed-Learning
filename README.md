# Distributed-Learning

This project focuses on exploring advanced machine learning techniques to address critical challenges in mobile networks. It comprises two main sub-projects:


1. **Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Coordinated Multipoint in Mobile Networks**: This sub-project aims to optimize resource allocation and enhance the quality of experience in mobile networks through the application of RL and multi-agent RL.

2. **Traffic Forecasting with Time Series Analysis using Federated Learning and Fully Distributed Learning in RAN**: The focus here is on predicting traffic patterns in Radio Access Networks (RAN) by leveraging time series analysis, federated learning, and fully distributed learning approaches.
